<p><b style="color: dodgerblue;">Iconify</b> is an open-source Android mobile application designed to empower users by allowing customization of various aspects of their device's user interface.</p>
<br>
<p>Originally conceived as a Substratum theme to modify system icons on any AOSP ROM, Iconify evolved over time. It transitioned into a Magisk module with Terminal GUI integration. However, the limitations of Substratum and Terminal GUI—such as applying overlays without previews—led to frustration. To simplify customization, I developed an application solely for personal use. Encouraged by public interest, I subsequently released Iconify to the wider community.</p>
